 * This method causes uploadedFiles to be populated:
 *
 *  curl -F "file=@sampleData0.1.r1254.xml" http://localhost:8080/api/upload
 *  caused the uploadedFiles to populate
 * (HTTP)  This  lets curl emulate a filled in form in which a user has pressed the submit
 *  button. This causes  curl  to  POST  data using the Content-Type multipart/form-data
 *  according to RFC1867. This enables uploading of binary files etc. To force  the
 * 'content' part to be a file, prefix the file name with an @ sign. To just get the content
 *  part from a file, prefix the file name with the  letter  <.  The  difference
 *  between @ and < is then that @ makes a file get attached in the post as a  file
 *  upload,  while the < makes a text field and just get the contents for that text
 *  field from a file.
 *
 * This method causes the body field to be populated:
 *  cat sampleData0.1.r1254.xml | curl -T - http://localhost:8080/api/upload
 *
 * Also, this tool provides good way to test PUT/POST but not multipart/form-data
