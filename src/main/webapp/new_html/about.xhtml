				<h1>About All for Good</h1>
				<p>Are you looking for ways to give back to your community? All for Good makes it simple to find and
				share volunteer activities with friends and family.				
				</p>
				<p>Inspired by the call of President Obama to engage more Americans in
				service, a group of individuals from the technology, marketing and
				public sectors came together to build an open source
				application that allows you to find and
				share volunteer activities.  All for Good lets you browse activities and find events
				based on your location or interests.  The site is governed by Our Good Works a nonprofit organization that was formed by some of the people who initiated the project and who support the product's growth.
				</p>
				
				<p>Even better - sign in with your primary social network to connect with
				friends, and discover and share interesting
				activities. Doing good is more fun together!
				</p>
				
				<h3>How did All for Good get started?</h3> 
				<p>When President Obama called on Americans to get out and serve even before he took office, people who led the online and on the ground effort looked to Silicon Valley (where lots of tech companies start and settle) for new tools to engage in service.  All this chatter ultimately turned into a groundswell of
				individuals from varied backgrounds — technology, marketing, academia, non-profit— coming together to volunteer their
				time and talents to create All for Good.
				</p>
				
				<p>From that initial spark, our ad hoc crew worked to bring the idea to life. Companies and organizations joined in and donated resources to help turn a
				shared idea into a reality.
				</p>
				
				<p>Now that we've gotten it started, we're looking to you, the community at large, to help us innovate and grow All
				for Good.
				</p>
				
				<h3>Who are we?</h3> 
				<p>Doing good takes many forms. Some people plant trees (trees are good!). Some people
				build houses. Some people create technology. There are a large number of individuals and organizations in the social sector already doing great work in this field - too many to name - and we tip our hats to all of them as we take the plunge and join the community (and look forward to collaborating with everyone!).
				</p>
				
				<p>We are a self-organized crew of software engineers, marketing managers, product developers
				and designers who have underestimated the cups of coffee and lines of code it would take to create All for Good.
				But if it helps you do good work, then the lost sleep is all worth
				it.
				</p>
				
				<p>Our core team is made up of volunteering enthusiasts from places like Google, Craigslist Foundation, UCLA, YouTube, FanFeedr and Aha! Ink. As 
				a contributor to the All for Good project, Google is hosting the All for Good website and products. Several Google engineers worked on All for Good 
				as a 20-percent project (Google lets engineers spend a day a week on projects that interest them), collaborating with a broader team to build the product.
				
				</p>
				
				<p>Lots of individuals and companies came together to get All for Good off the ground.  The activities you find on the site come from 
				nonprofits, companies, self-organized groups, and individuals. Founding activity providers include 1-800-volunteer.org, 1 Sky, AARP, American 
				Solutions for Winning the Future, American Red Cross, City of New York, The Corporation for National and Community Service, craigslist, Girl 
				Scouts of the USA, Habitat for Humanity, HandsOn Network and Points of Light Institute, Idealist, MeetUp, Mentor, Network for Good, Organizing 
				for America, ServeNet.org, Sierra Club, TechMission, The Extraordinaries, Truist, United Jewish Communities, United Way, Volunteer2, VolunteerMatch 
				and Youth Service America.
				</p>
				
				<p>And now that we've gotten it started, we're looking to you to help us innovate and grow the site.
